// Headless parking invariant tests — precision parking while avoiding
// obstacles, asserted entirely from recorded telemetry (no visual inspection).
//
// Drives the SAME `createRaceScenario` engine + the SAME `parkingCourse` /
// `PARKING_RACE_TUNING` definition the /parking web page imports, so a green
// test here means the page behaves the same way.
//
// HISTORY (2026-05): originally only `forward-pullin` parked; `reverse-perp`
// drove 40+ m the wrong way and `parallel` thrashed, both via a planner
// replan-failure storm (failedReplanRatio ≈ 0.99 / 0.42). The root causes were
// not the maneuvers themselves but a stack of mismatches in the shared runner:
//   1. the runner planned parking with RACE_AGENT (30 m/s, 4.5 m turn radius)
//      instead of PARKING_AGENT, so the time-cost heuristic was ~15× too weak
//      and A* degenerated into near-breadth-first search → the replan storm;
//   2. the pure-pursuit→chassis bridge dropped the reverse gear (threw away the
//      throttle sign) AND didn't flip the steer sign in reverse, so a planned
//      back-in was never executed — the car just coasted forward off-plan;
//   3. the planner's analytic Reeds-Shepp shot-to-goal was collapsed to a
//      straight chord (the bare node sequence discards the curve), so the
//      curved final approach was tracked as a diagonal that clipped a car;
//   4. parking replanned on the 300 ms race cadence, re-deciding the whole
//      multi-cusp maneuver every tick and oscillating at the forward↔reverse
//      cusp instead of committing to it.
// A fifth fix came from the web demo: the planning footprint was
// `defaultVehicleAgent`'s 3.2 × 1.8 m box, far smaller than the 4.8 × 2.0 m
// chassis the runner drives and three.js renders, so "collision-free" plans
// drove the real bumpers into the parked cars. The footprint now matches the
// true chassis and the (previously over-tight) stall spacing / aisle / gap were
// widened so the real car still fits.
//
// Fixing all five (see race-scenario.ts / race-primitives-scenarios.ts /
// parking-scenarios.ts / core analytic-shot poses) makes `forward-pullin` and
// `reverse-perp` park cleanly with a healthy planner. `parallel` used to reach
// the slot but rest ~16° off the curb; a Stanley-style terminal heading term
// (`terminalHeadingGain`, gated by the runner on distance to the TRUE goal) now
// straightens it onto the curb, so all three park square + centred and the
// predicate (`evaluateParked`, incl. a centering bound) agrees.
